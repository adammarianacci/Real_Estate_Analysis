# Coldwell Banker Real Estate Agency Needs Analysis

**Author**: [Adam Marianacci](mailto:adam.marianacci@gmail.com)

## Overview

This project analyzes the resource needs of Coldwell Banker Real Estate Agency. 

## Business Understanding

Coldwell Banker wants to buy undervalued homes in certain zipcodes to minimally renovate and sell for a profit. It is my job to find homes that are being listed significanty lower than the median price and look into what variables are causing these lowered prices so that I can properly advise Coldwell Banker on which homes to target.
